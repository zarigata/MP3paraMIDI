# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We, as members, contributors, and leaders of the MP3paraMIDI community, pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone. We commit to acting and interacting in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, experience level, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Accepting constructive criticism gracefully
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Project maintainers (led by Zarigata) are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces—GitHub repositories, issue trackers, pull requests, discussions, documentation, and community chat—and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces. Examples of representing our project include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainer (Zarigata). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident. Details of a reported issue will only be shared with those directly involved in resolving the matter.

## Enforcement Guidelines
Maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. **Correction**
   - *Community Impact*: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.
   - *Consequence*: A private, written warning from project maintainers, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate.

   - *Community Impact*: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.
   - *Consequence*: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time.

   - *Community Impact*: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.
   - *Consequence*: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time.
